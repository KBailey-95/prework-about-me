// no comments here to describe any of these functions
// booFacts was not created as an array, leaving the following function useless as there is no value set to index. The entire booFacts var is treated as a single string
//some close quotations came after the comma or in other seemingly random places designed to separate positions in the array. This was difficult becasuse the english-speaking inclination was to see these as normal statements I was misinterpreting
//no quotations around pink
//no indention here
// clicks were not in quotations so buttons didn't work
