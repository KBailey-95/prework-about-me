    <h1><em>Frank Ocean, a Beautiful Enigma</em></h1>
    <p>
        Frank Ocean is one of the most talented artists in the world right now. Whether you want a songwriter, a singer, a rapper, or all three Frank is your guy. I could speak at length about why that is, but I think the easiest way to qualify his greatness is to say that he got both Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce to perform uncredited voacl features on back to back albums!

    <h2>Brief Musical Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California, on October 28, 1987. He grew up in New Orleans, but moved to Los Angeles in his late teens to pursue a career in music. Ocean started out ghostwriting tracks for such pop stars as Justin Bieber and Beyonc√©, but soon achieved fame as an artist when, in 2011, he released a mixtape of his own music, titled nostalgia, ULTRA. His next effort, channel ORANGE, was unveiled in 2012 to both critical and popular acclaim, and he followed with the back-to-back releases of Endless and Blonde in 2016.
